# Image Recognition using Deep Networks üïµÔ∏è



## Overview

This project contains exercises related to image recognition using deep learning networks with the Keras library. The exercises cover topics such as identifying handwritten numbers, deep convolutional networks, identifying objects from images, and low-level functions in deep learning.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1: Identifying Handwritten Numbers

For this exersice we explored simple image recognition by classifying handwritten numbers. The goal was to build a model that can recognize and classify numbers based on their images.

### Exercise 2: Identifying Objects from Images
This exercise focuses on identifying objects from images with high variations in position, size, and viewing angle using Convolutional neural network. The dataset used is CIFAR-10, containing color images of objects with 10 categories.

### Exercise 3: Low-Level Functions
Deep learning relies on fundamental operations such as convolution, nonlinear activation, pooling, and normalization. In this exercise, we implemented these low-level functions to gain a deeper understanding of how they work.
